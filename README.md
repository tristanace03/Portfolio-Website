# Portfolio Website Creation 

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. This serves as a personal project to practice front-end programming. 

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website serves as my online portfolio to showcase my projects, experiences, contact information and more. It's designed to give those who wish to learn more about me as a student and a person (for example, if a recruiter wanted to learn more about me than just the information on my resume...). The portfolio also includes links to other relevant profiles. 

### Purpose

I have two initial goals with creating this portfolio website: provide a central place that displays my experience as a Computer Science student, and to learn more about front-end development. The website is initially coded in HTML and CSS, but I hope to use the website to teach myself more about front-end development. 

### Code Structure

- index.html: the main page of the project. Includes the about, projects, experience and contact sections of my portfolio.
- style.css: the CSS file that styles the HTML page to ensure a consistent look and feel.
