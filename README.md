# Portfolio-Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The website serves as my online portfolio to showcase my projects, experiences, contact information and more. It's designed to give those who wish to learn more about me as a student and a person (for example, if a recruiter wanted to learn more about me than just the information on my resume...). The portfolio also includes links to other relevant profiles. 

## Purpose
I have two initial goals with creating this portfolio website: provide a central place that displays my experience as a Computer Science student, and to learn more about front-end development. The website is initially coded in HTML and CSS, but I hope to use the website to teach myself more about front-end development.
